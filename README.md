* Heph/kami chapther

Long before time had a name, a player by the name of "3arthqu4ke" who was a Highland member at the time became a contributor of a client known as "Hephatsues", which was a fork of Kami (A very popular client at the time)
Hephatsues was originally made by "X0Z0" and "hub", originally called "RatHack", the client was made for the player "kznnor", later 3arthqu4ke forked Hephatsues to do the stuff he wants and expand his java knowledge, there was a 1-2 months period where both Hephatsues and 3arth's fork updated separately,
when the player named "SquidLauncer" leaked 3arth's hephatsues it was then renamed to "Phobos", named after one of Mar's moons, he made huge changes to the Gui so that it looks distingouishable from Hephatsues (cant spell), one questions Phobos members would ask to check if someone was actually who they were is "whatâ€™s the bottom module in the movement catagory", the answer was YPort.
At the time of this Phobos kami base Gui was never leaked. and "YPort" was no module you see on everyday clients back in 2019. it was special, YPort was basically like Speed LowHop mode but it teleports you to the ground automaticaly each 1 tick to bypass NCP (the anticheat used on all anarchy servers)

* Phobos 2 Chapter

FastForward more time, 3arthqu4ke tried to make a good AutoTrap on Phobos, but he wasn't able to dueto issues with Kami's offsets, he also wanted to start a new fresh start with his own base and system, So he created "Phobos 2" (that wasn't the client name. it was just Phobos with a new base but nowdays we call it Phobos 2 to diffrenciate)
Phobos 2 was developed by 3arthqu4ke from late 2019 to late 2020, it was very good many players got greedy and wanted to get their hands on it one way or another. A player known as "Travis" who's the developer of another popular client, wurst+2 was able to token log & rat "Crystalinqq" using a ratted version of his client, he was able to optain access to the Phobos src and Discord account. to avoid their src being sold for profits and get revenge on Travis and his friends, the Emperium
Crystalinqq and Megyn (Another phobos dev) created an updated version of Phobos with malware in it and published it to Github, dueto the source code being public on Github and Phobos not having a bad reputation back then, everyone assumed it's safe, within 2 days of the release 4,000 players have ran Phobos and were infected.
